                <p>At <span className="text-primary fw-bold ">AAHARA VASTRA,</span> we are driven by a single purpose: to connect those with
                    surplus resources to those in need. Every day, countless celebrations and
                    events produce an abundance of food, much of which goes to waste. Our
                    mission is to bridge this gap by providing a platform where donors can easily
                    share available resources with nearby charities, shelters, and individuals .</p>

                <p> <span className="fw-bold">Post about Surplus Food : </span>
                    Whether itâ€™s leftover food from parties, events, or
                    restaurants, users can quickly update our app, making the information available
                    for charities or individuals nearby who need it.
                </p>


                <p> <span className="fw-bold fs-6">List Old or Gently Used Clothes : </span>
                    Donors can also share details about clothing
                    they no longer need, helping individuals and families get access to essential
                    items without unnecessary waste.<br />
                    By facilitating these connections, Ahara Vastra ensures resources are redirected
                    to benefit those who need them most.
